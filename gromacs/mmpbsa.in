Sample input file for GB calculation
#This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Althought, we tried to used the input files as recommended in the 
#Amber manual, some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations. Feel free to change the parameters 
#according to what is better for your system.
